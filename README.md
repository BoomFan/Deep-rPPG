Deep learning (neural network) based remote photoplethysmography: how to extract pulse signal from video using deep learning tools

## Special application on neonates
A custom YOLO network is used to crop the baby as a preprocessing step.
This network was created based on this repo: [https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3][PyTorch-YOLOv3]
